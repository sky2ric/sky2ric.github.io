# Welcome a.k.a Abstract
Here's the road less taken: 
A new way of settling payments for private housing properties. 

This is an effort of trying to implement **smart contract** into the existing (traditional) process when dealing with **real-estates transaction**. In this project we will be using the process adopted by the real-estate market in **Hong Kong** as an example.

This project will involve a simple relationship between **tenants and landlords**. Landlords has to keep track on his tenants paying the rents on time, and allow (or deny) the access to his properties on a periodic basis. Our project will aim to **automate the entire process** with the use of smart contract, from keeping track of the rent, to allowing access (or denying access) on a real time query basis. 

Our demo implementation will involve using **[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) as our blockchain backbone**, and as well as traditional front-end and back-end servers on [Java](https://www.java.com) for our tenants and landlords to interact with the blockchain. 

Our demo implementation will also involve a smart door lock. This door lock will be able to **query the blockchain in realtime**, checking if the tenant has paid his rent, thus allowing or denying access. **A [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) will be used to demonstrate this ability.**

# 1. Introduction To Project

This project is an demo of showing the use of smart contract, which is a **digital form of traditional paper-signed contract**, can help us with doing transaction in a once-off, or a periodic manner, involving one or more parties. 

In the course of the demo, we will demonstrate the ability for blockchain to [decentralize](https://ethereum.org/en/dapps/), and the benefits (and also the drawbacks) of such implementation on **paying rents**. 

The smart contract that we will be using is on the [ethereum blockchain](https://ethereum.org), and the underlying programming language is [solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io). At the same time, we will implement a front-end web client written in [Angular with Java](https://angular.io/) for tenant and landlord to manage their properties, a database to store such information [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), and a rudimentary door lock using a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
